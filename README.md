### IronFenceGate

Here is an iron fence gate, something sadly missing from vanilla Minecraft.

тЪая╕П The associated resourcepack is required to render the gates. It may be used standalone or merged with an existing resourcepack.

ЁЯЪл If you cannot host the resourcepack, you cannot use IronFenceGate on a public server.
